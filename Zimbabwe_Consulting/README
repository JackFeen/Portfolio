This project was carried out in a partnership between The Society of Sustainable Business and Equip Mozambique.

The key driver of this project was to audit the existing business model for Equip Mozambique's "Juris Law and Rights App", allowing UTD students interested in business sustainability to gain hands-on consulting experience, 
while giving Equip Mozambique access to a team of young minds dedicated to innovating their current business model.

Our end result was a plan aiding them in securing fiscal sustainability, user growth, and an initial market entry plan into Zimbabwe.
